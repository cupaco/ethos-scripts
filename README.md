# 1st Script: NVIDIA-power-limit

This script will detect any NVIDIA graphic card and will reset the powerlimit in watt.                
It's optimal to set a NVIDIA GTX1070 to a limit of 100W to save around 30% of energy.              
                                                 
Set a new Powerlimit for NVIDIA GPUs on ethos or other Linux, 
which has nvidia-smi installed.  

 Usage: ./NVIDIA-power-limit $POWER_LIMIT                 
 $POWER_LIMIT could be 150 or 99.5
